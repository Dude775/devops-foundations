# Projects

## The Rolling Project Concept

Instead of isolated exercises, this course builds one continuous project that grows with each module. Each new skill gets applied to the same application, creating a realistic production system layer by layer.

- Module 04: Write the application in Python
- Module 05: Version control it with Git
- Module 08: Containerize it with Docker
- Module 09: Automate deployment with CI/CD
- Module 10: Orchestrate with Kubernetes
- Module 12: Define infrastructure with Terraform
- Module 16: Monitor with Grafana

By the end, you have a single project that demonstrates the full DevOps stack - not a collection of disconnected hello-world exercises.
