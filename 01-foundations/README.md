# Module 01: Foundations - The Philosophy Before the Tools

> **Status**: Complete
> **Duration**: Week 1
> **Prerequisites**: [Module 00 - Pre-Course](../00-pre-course/)

## Overview

Before touching a single tool, this module establishes the mental models that separate a DevOps engineer from someone who just runs commands. What is an application really? How do teams actually work together (and against each other)? Why do requirements matter more than code? What does "production" actually mean?

This is the foundation everything else builds on.

## Learning Objectives

- [x] Understand that an application is far more than code
- [x] Map the full Software Development Life Cycle
- [x] Identify team roles, responsibilities, and natural conflicts
- [x] Distinguish development from production environments
- [x] Grasp DevOps as an architectural discipline
- [x] Understand data responsibility and security implications

## Key Takeaways

The biggest shift in Week 1: DevOps is not about tools. It is about understanding the full picture - the organization, the teams, the data, the risks - and then building systems that hold up under real conditions. Every concept here resurfaces later when choosing architectures, designing pipelines, and making production decisions.
