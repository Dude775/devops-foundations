# Iron Rules - Week 1

Principles collected from the Foundations module. These are non-negotiable truths.

---

**"An application is not code."**
It is a solution living inside an organization - code + infrastructure + processes + people + decisions.

**"Tech decisions are also organizational decisions."**
Every architecture choice affects teams, budgets, timelines, and capabilities.

**"If it works, don't touch it."**
Stability has value. Change for the sake of change introduces risk.

**"Any system too open will be breached."**
Security is not a feature - it is a constraint that must be enforced at every layer.

**"What you don't need, don't use."**
Complexity is cost. Every unused dependency, feature, or service is a liability.

**"Always think worst case."**
Design for failure. Plan for the spike. Assume the breach. Hope is not a strategy.

**"A requirement not defined correctly doesn't disappear - it comes back as bugs."**
Ambiguity in requirements multiplies into chaos downstream.

**"Bug in code = incident. Bug in data = crisis."**
You can patch code. You cannot un-leak data.

**"Code that works in dev is not necessarily production-ready."**
The gap between development and production is where DevOps lives.
