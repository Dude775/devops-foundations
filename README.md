## Learning Path

### 1. HTML - Complete ✅

**Course**: SoloLearn HTML
**Status**: Complete
**Current Progress**: 5/5 lessons completed (3 lessons + 1 booster + 1 lesson)

#### Lesson 1: The Core Web Technology

![Lesson 1](html/images/lesson1-core-web-technology.png)

**Key Points:**
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages
- HTML describes the structure and content of a web page
- HTML consists of elements represented by tags
- Browsers interpret HTML to display formatted content
- HTML works alongside CSS (styling) and JavaScript (interactivity) as core web technologies

#### Lesson 2: HTML Code

![Lesson 2](html/images/lesson2-html-code.png)

**Key Points:**
- HTML documents have a defined structure with essential elements
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type
- The `<html>` element is the root of an HTML page
- The `<head>` contains meta information about the document
- The `<body>` contains the visible page content
- HTML tags usually come in pairs: opening tag `<tag>` and closing tag `</tag>`

**Code Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Lesson 3: Headings

![Lesson 3](html/images/lesson3-headings.png)

**Key Points:**
- HTML provides six levels of headings: `<h1>` through `<h6>`
- `<h1>` is the most important (largest), `<h6>` is the least important (smallest)
- Use only one `<h1>` per page for proper document structure
- Follow correct heading hierarchy - don't skip levels (e.g., h1 → h2 → h3)
- Headings are container tags - they require both opening and closing tags
- Empty tags (like `<br>` and `<img>`) don't have closing tags

#### Lesson 4: AI-Generated Practice

![Lesson 4](html/images/lesson4-ai-practice.png)

**Key Points:**
- Reviewed angle brackets (`< >`) as the fundamental HTML syntax
- Practiced paragraph tags `<p>` for text content
- Reinforced understanding of container tags (require closing tags) vs empty tags (no closing tag)
- The browser acts as an HTML translator - converting tags into visual elements
- HTML controls the structure of the page, defining what content appears and in what order

#### Lesson 5: Images

![Lesson 5](html/images/lesson5-images.png)

**Key Points:**
- The `<img>` tag is an empty tag - no closing tag needed
- The `src` attribute points to the image URL or file path
- Image URLs must be enclosed in quotes: `src="image.jpg"`
- Broken image icon appears when the path is wrong or image can't be loaded
- Web servers store and serve images to browsers when requested
