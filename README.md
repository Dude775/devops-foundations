# DevOps Field Guide - From Theory to Production

A practitioner's field guide for the journey from fundamentals to production-grade DevOps engineering.

## What This Is

This repository operates on three levels:

1. **Field Guide** - Distilled concepts, patterns, and principles for each DevOps domain, written to be referenced in practice
2. **Learning Journal** - Honest reflections, surprises, and connections discovered along the way
3. **Live Projects** - A rolling project that evolves with each module, accumulating real infrastructure

## Iron Rules

Principles collected throughout the course. These are non-negotiable truths earned through practice.

- "An application is not code." - it is a solution living inside an organization
- "Tech decisions are also organizational decisions."
- "If it works, don't touch it."
- "Any system too open will be breached."
- "What you don't need, don't use."
- "Always think worst case."
- "A requirement not defined correctly doesn't disappear - it comes back as bugs."
- "Bug in code = incident. Bug in data = crisis."
- "Code that works in dev is not necessarily production-ready."

*This list grows with each module.*
